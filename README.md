## Early ICAHT Prediction Model (eIPM) calculators

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Early ICAHT Prediction Model (eIPM) calculators. You can access the calculators at the following link: [https://eipm.fredhutch.org](https://eipm.fredhutch.org).

### Background
Immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT), which are graded according to [EHA/EBMT consensus criteria](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/142/10/865/496185/Immune-effector-cell-associated-hematotoxicity-EHA), is associated with high morbidity, transfusion dependency, growth factor requirement, and severe infections following CAR T-cell therapy. The ability to predict the probability of severe (grade 3-4) early ICAHT (eICAHT) can risk-stratify patients and guide future studies of possible interventions to mitigate this toxicity. 

The eIPMs use regression models developed by Liang et al. to quickly evaluate the probability of severe eICAHT for patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy. eIPM<sub>Pre</sub> consists of disease type (ALL vs. other), pre-lymphodepletion (LD) absolute neutrophil count, pre-LD platelet count, pre-LD LDH, and pre-LD ferritin. eIPM<sub>Post</sub> consists of disease type (ALL vs. other), pre-LD ANC, pre-LD platelet count, pre-LD LDH, and day +3 ferritin.
